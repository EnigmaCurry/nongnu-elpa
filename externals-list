;; -*- lisp-data -*-

;; List of packages that are maintained externally.
;; The list is made of elements of the form (NAME . PLIST)
;;
;; Where PLIST uses the following properties
;;
;; :external URL
;;   This specifies the location of the upstream code, usually a Git URL.
;;
;; :version-map MAP
;;   A list of element of the form (ORIG-VERSION REMAPPED-VERSION REVISION)
;;   This allows replacing the ORIG-VERSION from the <pkg>.el file
;;   with REMAPPED-VERSION (e.g. because the ORIG-VERSION is not a valid
;;   version number, is missing, or because we want to create a new package
;;   from the same code version).
;;   It also makes it possible to specify that this ORIG-VERSION
;;   (or REMAPPED-VERSION if non-nil) corresponds to REVISION to override
;;   the default heuristic which looks at the commit that modified the
;;   "Version:" header.
;;
;; :dont-release REGEXP
;;   A regexp matching version numbers which should not be released.
;;   This can be used for example to prevent releasing alpha/beta quality code
;;   while still allowing this code to appear with proper version info
;;   in the NonGNU-devel archive.
